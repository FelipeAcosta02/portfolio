# Hey!
This is my portfolio website's code.
Open source and free for any who pleases to use the design and stuff that is employed for the visuals.
Bootstrapped with `create-react-app` and uses `rebass`, `react-spring`, `blobs`, `lodash`, and `bit`.
All available from the npm registry.

The folder structure is very simple:
|Folder|Use|
|-|-|
|Components|All visual components used throughout the app|
|Routes|All things needed for routing|
|Containers|Contains functional components and hocs|
|Views|All the screens that the site has|
